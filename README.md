# Twitter_scraping
To scrape the data of our choice of hashtags from twitter and storing it in .csv and .json files

Initially installed and imported the required libraries.
Created variables for the required user inputs such as Hashtag, date, no. of days of tweet, no. of tweets, etc
Created an empty list to store the scrape data
Used a function to scrape the data from the twitter and appended them in the above created empty list
Created one dataframe in pandas and exported the same into a .csv file
Created one database in MongoDB along with collection and stored the scraped data in json format
Finally visualized the scraped data as pandas dataframe in tabular format
